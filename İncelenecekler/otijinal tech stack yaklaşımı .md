[Music] I just don't understand. Why is finding a good tech stack so hard? I just want a fast and easy way to set up a new project. Is that so hard? Well, apparently the answer is yes. Trying to find a good tech stack is like opening up Pandora's box. There's so many tech stacks. There's so many opinions, a whole bunch of people saying, "Oh, my tech stack is better than yours." You want proof? Just look at the comment section of this video. There's probably people arguing about a tech stack right there. But on the rare occasion where people aren't arguing, there's reasonable people saying, "Oh, your tech stack depends on your project." Fair enough. All right. It's a classic. It depends. So, it had me thinking, okay, why do people build projects in the first place? Maybe for education, to learn new things. Reasonable. Maybe out of necessity. To fix your garbage code makes sense. Maybe a hint of passion. Or, if we're being honest, money. But if you really think about it, why do a lot of people want to learn to code? Excuse my language, but it's to get a job. And why do they want a job? To increase stakeholder value. For you unemployed people, that means money. And why do some people make passion projects? Is it really out of passion? sometimes, but other times it's to quit their job because of money. It's all money. It always has been money. So, when you think about it like that, if everyone's building projects to make money, maybe, and hear me out here, this might be a crazy idea, we should use a tech stack that helps us make money fast. Oh my god, I did it. I cracked the code to a good tech stack. Today, we are not software developers. We are lazy capitalists. Maximum profit, minimum effort, we will all be rich. Yeah, this video is sponsored by Clerk. Yeah, money. So, what exactly is this text act? I like to call this the ultimate blazingly fast money-making text stack. For our front end and back end, we're going to go with Nex.js. Yes, I know that some of you don't like Nex.js, but it's great. Okay, it's one of the easiest ways to deploy a backend and front end at the same time that fully understand each other. But if you really don't want to use Nex.js or you already know your project doesn't need those features, I also recommend React Router or Tanstack Start. They're also really great. But if you don't want to use React or JavaScript in general, go figure that out because I only know JavaScript. Sorry, I can't code. What do you expect? Now, for our database, we're going to go with Convex because not only is it a database, it's a realtime database. So, when your data changes, it updates instantly. No refresh buttons, no please wait, no disgusting loading screen. The moment the data changes, it updates in real time. It just works. You don't have to mess around with websockets and coding all that from scratch. You can just add Convex and let them do everything for you. Because I promise you the engineers there know way more about databases and websockets than you and me. Now another great thing about convex is you get type safety because everything in convex is Typescript. Everything your schemas TypeScript your database queries TypeScript your API TypeScript your mom probably TypeScript since everything is type- safe. This means you'll get amazing autocomplete when you're writing code and you'll also get instant feedback when something's wrong. This means you can catch bugs before they happen instead of discovering them when customers are trying to use your app. Basically, JavaScript was a mistake and it should have been statically typed in the first place. Now, for O and billing to start making some of that money, we're going to go with Clerk because they have the easiest, the fastest, and the best developer experience for setting up O and now billing. It has all the login methods you need, emails, passwords, usernames, login with Google, GitHub, Discord, even Roblox. I'm kidding. Clerk should add that though. You get user management. You get a full dashboard where you can see every user. Ban the bozos that ruin everything. Check who's paying. check who's not paying. You get to see the user profiles, metadata, custom fields, everything you'd need. And I know what some of you are thinking. Wait, Convex has Oth. Why don't we use that? And recently, there's also better off, so what about that? And you're right. Those options do exist, and I did use them, and I really like them. But then I learned about Clerk's new billing feature, and it's one of the best things ever. It's honestly lifechanging for payments. But we'll talk about that later because now for our UI, we're going to go with Shad Cien and Tailwind because it's the fastest way to set up a nicel looking UI and nobody's going to give you money if your project is ugly. And finally, for hosting, we're going to go with Versel because it's really easy and it takes like 2 seconds to host if you're using Nex.js, but you can use a different hosting provider if you want. I just use it because it's really fast and convenient. This is basically the fast food of tech stacks. And before you complain, think about it. Fast food is quick, cheap, not as cheap as it used to be. Consistent and it gets the job done. You know exactly what you're getting. You want a burger? 2 minutes. Now, is this tech stack gourmet? No. Well, debatable. Will it feed your family? Absolutely. Will tech Twitter judge you? Yes. Is your bank account going to care? No. So, what do you all think about this text? Why are you hosting? What are you stupid? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You all have your own little special tech stack. Cool. Good for you. But this is my video, so I'm just going to ignore your opinion. Now, the beauty of this tech stack is that it comes with a lot of features that would normally take you weeks or even months to build from scratch. You'd need to either one, build everything yourself, or two, use a bunch of different services. Either way, you're looking at managing 8 to 10 different services that don't integrate that well, or you're spending months building features that this stack gives you instantly. But it's more expensive. Yes, technically that's true. But that's only if your project has a lot of these things we call users. And if I'm being brutally honest with all of you, 99% of you won't have users. But on the 1% chance you do, you'll probably still qualify for the free plan of Convex and Clerk because they're really generous and amazing. For example, Clerk gives you 10,000 monthly active users for free. And the key word here is active. And Clerk defines that as someone who returns to your app 24 plus hours after signing up. Which means if someone makes an account and they never use your project again, Clerk doesn't count it. By the time you actually need to pay for any of these services, you're already making more than enough money to live comfortably. Here, let's do some quick math. Let's say you charge $10 a month for your project. Let's multiply that by 10,000 users based on clerk's limit. That gives you 100,000. This means you'll be making around $100,000 a month. That's a lot. If you're making around $100,000 a month and you're complaining about paying a few hundred for infrastructure, you're just being Mr. Krabs level greedy. Okay, I'm being a little generous. You'll probably pay a little more than a few hundred because there's stuff like the database fee, the hosting fee, the biggest of them all, the billing fee. But even then, you're making a good amount of money. You're rich. There's no sugar coating this. You're just rich. And if you're still somehow breaking even when you're making this much money, this might be a skill issue on your end. For a quality database service and all service, I think it's worth it because these services are maintained by engineers that are way smarter than you and me. Now, of course, this doesn't apply to all projects. Maybe you want the project to be free, which is fair, but remember what this video is about, money. This isn't about using the coolest technologies or to learn something new or for a resume project. That's what personal and hobby projects are for. This tech stack is all about that money. And for that specific purpose, this stack is blazingly fast and it works great. And it could change in the future because tech is always changing and there's still a lot of services I haven't used. But as of right now, this tech stack is peak. And it's not just me. A lot of other people like this tech stack and I'm positive it's going to get more popular in the future. But you know what? None of this matters if you can't make money. That's the point of this video. And this this is where traditional tech stacks make me want to commit arson. Let me walk you through how traditional payment flows work step by step. So your user wants to give you money. Simple, right? Wrong. Here's what actually happens. Step one, the user logs in. You have your all system. That's a whole another problem. Cool. User logs in. We know who they are. Step two, user clicks your subscribe button. They buy your GBT rapper. Okay. Your front end sends a request to your backend saying, "Hey, Karen from Ohio wants to pay us." Your backend now has to create a Stripe checkout session. And this is where the problems start because when you're creating that checkout session, you have to create a Stripe customer. Now, what's the problem with this? Your user exists in two places, your off system and Stripe. The problem here is they don't talk to each other. They have different IDs. Your user has ID, user 123. Stripe creates a customer ID, customer ABC. So if you try to use your user ID, this is what would happen. Hey Stripe, did user 123 pay?" Stripe would say, "Who the is user 123?" Which means you have to map them yourself in your database manually. Step three. Once your backend processes the Stripe checkout session, your backend is going to respond with a checkout URL. and make sure to use the customer ID and not the user ID. Your front end is then going to redirect them to Stripe and now they're on Stripe's website. Step four, let's say they actually pay or they don't. Stripe now needs to tell you what happened. And how do they do that? Web hooks. Step five, Stripe sends that web hook to your server, right? But wait, it could be fake. So, you need to verify the signature. Wait a minute. Stripe has like a one gazillion types of web hook events. So, now you have to implement those. Step six. Okay, you received the web hook. You have the code to handle all those events. Now you need to update your database because Stripe's not doing that. You have to find the user by their Stripe customer ID, which I hope you saved. If you didn't, you already messed up. Now you have to update their subscription status. And don't mess this up because Karen from Ohio already paid. This is all on you. Step seven, here's the best part. Your front end doesn't know any of this happened yet. It's still sitting there like an idiot. So, it has to keep asking your back end, did they pay yet? Did they pay yet? Did they pay yet? Did they pay yet? Step eight. Finally, your front end knows they're a paying customer. And now Karen from Ohio has her premium subscription all in a day's work. Unless the web hook failed or arrived late or there was a race condition or you got rate limited or now you see the problem with this. The process is annoying and there's a lot of code you have to write. Now it's not difficult, but it is annoying to have to deal with. And there's also a lot of areas where this could go wrong. You're going to be there at 3:00 a.m. looking at your logs, looking at your database, trying to figure out why Karen from Ohio paid for premium but can't access premium. And you know what the problem usually is? Your programming skills. Well, that too, but the web hooks. Which is why I'm very thankful for Clerk for handling all this for us. Instead of writing hundreds of lines of payment code, you basically write zero. And this is possible because authentication and billing are pretty tied together. In order for a customer to buy a subscription, they usually need an account, which means we don't have to deal with those yucky web hooks anymore. We don't have to deal with state syncing. We don't have to deal with any of Stripe's APIs. We can just let Clerk handle all of that. What? Basically money. Now, I'm pretty lazy. You're also probably lazy. So, you already know why I'm loving this feature. Now, some big disclaimers, though. Their billing feature is still in beta. So, a lot of features are still in development, but once they have them ready, I am confident that this will be one of the best ways to add payments to your projects. Wow. Okay, that rant was longer than I expected. All right, let's move on and let's be real programmers and let me show you how easy it is to set up a new project with this tech stack. By the end of this, we'll have everything database authentication and billing so you can start working on your next billiondoll idea. All right, so step one is setting up Nex.js Tailwind and Chaten. I like to do this using Chhatzen's website. So let's go to Chaten's website. Let's click get started. Select Next.js or whatever framework you picked. And then we're going to copy this terminal command that it shows here. Feel free to use whichever package manager you like to use. For this video, I'm going to go with npm since more people use npm. I personally use pmppm though. Now inside your terminal, you're going to paste the command and then run it. And then you're going to go through this quick installation process. First, it's going to ask whether you want a next.js project or a monor repo. For our project, we're going to select next.js project. Now, once you select that, name your project. Name it whatever you want. Press enter and the project will start setting up. Now, the final part is asking what type of theme you want. Feel free to select whatever option. You're probably going to change the theme anyways, so it's not that important. And after you do that, it should be complete. So, open up your IDE and then run npm rundev. And just like that, your project is set up. Step two, setting up convex. In your terminal, we're going to install convex by writing the command npm install convex. And once you have that installed, the next thing we're going to do is run the command npx convex dev. And this will start the process of creating a new convex project. Once you do that, convex is going to ask if you want to create a new project or choose an existing project. We're going to go with creating a new project. And after that, it's going to ask us to name the project. Name it whatever you want. If you want to keep the same name, just press enter. And the last thing it's going to ask is if you want to use cloud deployment or local deployment. If you're into hosting it yourself, go with local. But I don't use Arch Linux, so we're going to go with cloud. And once you do that, Convex is set up. It's that easy. Once that finishes, you can check your project, and you're going to notice this Convex folder. This folder is going to contain all our backend and database code. But we'll come back to this later. We have one more thing to set up. Step three, setting up O with Clerk. Setting up Clerk is pretty easy, too. We're going to go to clerk.com or click my link in the description if you're lazy and sign up or log in. Once you're logged into clerk, click create application. Name it whatever you want. Money printer, million-dollar app, I don't care. And now you get to do the beautiful part. Select whatever signin options you want. And once you're done, click create application. And once you do that, you're going to see these steps to set up clerk. We're actually going to follow the first three steps. We're not going to follow the rest because it's a little different with convex. So go to step one and copy the install command. And in your terminal, run the install command. Once that install finishes, go back to your clerk dashboard, go to step two and copy your API keys. Once you copy those keys, go back to your project and in yourv.loc file that convex created. I forgot to mention it does that. Sorry. You're going to paste your clerk API keys. As always with API keys and environment variables, do not commit this file. Do not tweet these keys. Don't show these keys to anyone. Wait a minute. All right. Now that we finished that, we're going to go back to Clerk's dashboard and we're going to move on to step three and copy the code in step three. Go back to your project. And once you do that, we're going to create a middleware file. You're going to create this in the root of your project. So create that middleware file and paste that code into the file. This middleware file is what allows Clerk to do authentication and to protect routes. So users can't access certain pages if they're not signed in. Technically, we just finished our clerk setup. Yay. The problem is it's not connected to Convex. A. So let's fix that. Step four, connecting Clerk and Convex. For this step, we're going to be using the guide from Clerk's documentation like a proper programmer. I'll leave this guide in the description, too, if you're too lazy to search it up. So, first we're going to go to our clerk dashboard and we're going to set up a JWT template. If you don't know what a JWT is, then um I strongly recommend doing research on that. In our clerk dashboard, we're going to click the configure tab and then you're going to look for the JWT template section. Once you find it, click it and you're going to be on this screen. Once you're on that screen, you're going to click add new template and all you're going to do is select the template dropown and change it from blank to convex. Once you do that, save your changes and copy that issuer URL there. Once you copy it, we're going to go back to our project. And inside your local env file, we're going to create a new environment variable. And this environment variable is in clerk's docs. It's right underneath step three, the first part. You can copy and paste that if you want. I'm just going to type it out because I'm too lazy to re-record this. So, in your env file, create that environment variable. And then you're going to paste that issuer URL you copied from clerk. The next thing we're going to do is we actually have to add these environment variables to our convex database. Because if you don't, Convex is going to yell at you like this. Yeah, I messed up my own tutorial that I wrote. So, copy that clerk environment variable we just made and then go to Convex's website and go to your dashboard. Once you're in the dashboard, select your project, select settings, and then select environment variables. Click the add button. Once you do that, you're just going to paste with controlV or commandV and everything will be added to this. Thank you, Convex, for having this copy paste feature. Now that we finished that, we're going to go back to the clerk docs. You're going to copy this code snippet right here that says export default. And we're going to go back to our project. And inside the convex folder, we're going to create this file, o.config.ts, because we're using TypeScript. And inside that file, you're going to paste the code snippet that you copied. All that's left to do is to add the clerk provider in our project. So go to the clerk docs and we're going to move on to step five where it says configure the clerk and convex providers. You're going to copy the code right here that's underneath component/convexclient provider.tsx. And inside your project, we're going to create this file. So underneath the components, you're going to create the file convexclient provider.tsx. Once you create that, just paste the code that you copied and then go back to the clerk docs and we're also going to copy th naber video buldum orada tech stack diyor da yorumun neler
ChatGPT:
Bu videoda anlatılan “blazingly fast money-making tech stack” konsepti — yani en az eforla, en hızlı şekilde para kazandıran modern full-stack seti — YBIS projenin mevcut mimarisiyle oldukça yakından örtüşüyor, ama birkaç farkla.

💡 Videodaki Stack’in Özeti
Katman	Önerilen Teknoloji	Neden?
Frontend & Backend	Next.js	Tek proje içinde SSR, API Routes ve edge deployment imkânı
Database / Backend-as-a-Service	Convex	Type-safe, real-time database (Firebase benzeri ama Typescript native)
Auth + Billing	Clerk	Auth + Payments tek sistem (Stripe alt yapısı)
UI Kit	shadcn/ui + Tailwind	Hızlı, estetik ve React tabanlı UI
Hosting	Vercel	Tek tuşla deploy, CI/CD otomatik
Amaç	“Maximum profit, minimum effort”	Hızlı MVP → gelir üretimi
🧩 YBIS’in Mevcut Stack’iyle Karşılaştırma
Belgelere göre senin projenin çekirdek yapısı şöyle:

Frontend/Mobile: React Native + Zustand + React Hook Form 

Backend: Node.js (Hono framework) + PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM) + Redis 

Auth: Google OAuth2 (tam entegre) 

Deployment: Vercel + Docker (Nginx proxy, SSL) 

AI: OpenAI / Anthropic / Groq entegrasyonu 

Yani senin sistemin geleneksel backend-first mimaride (DB, API, mobil istemci) çalışıyor; videodaki model ise backend-as-a-service (Convex/Clerk) kullanarak “server’ı atlamayı” hedefliyor.

⚙️ YBIS için Uyumlu/Alternatif Yaklaşım
Alan	Mevcut Teknoloji	Videodaki muadil	Uyum ve öneri
Backend API	Hono + PostgreSQL	Convex (Realtime DB)	Convex yerine Supabase veya Neon + Edge Functions tercih edilebilir (benzer developer-experience, üretim-ready).
Auth + Billing	Google OAuth + JWT	Clerk	Clerk’i yalnızca UI-Auth layer olarak ekleyip mevcut Google token flow’unu koruyabilirsin.
Hosting	Docker + Vercel + Nginx	Vercel (tam)	Zaten kullanıyorsun, sadece Docker-proxy’yi CI pipeline’a dahil edip otomatik sertifika yenilemesi eklenmiş.
UI	React Native (mobile)	shadcn/ui + Tailwind (web)	Mobil sürümüne paralel olarak Next.js tabanlı web dashboard eklenebilir; shadcn + Tailwind ile MVP çok hızlı çıkar.
Payments	Henüz yok	Clerk Billing (Stripe)	Aynı stratejiyi izleyebilirsin: Clerk Billing veya doğrudan Stripe Checkout entegrasyonu.
Realtime / Sync	Redis planlanıyor	Convex auto-sync	Redis Streams + Socket.IO ile kendi real-time katmanını oluşturman Convex’in işlevini karşılar.
💸 “Lazy Capitalist” Perspektifinden Değerlendirme
YBIS’in güçlü tarafı: modüler mimari, AI entegrasyonu, Google ekosistemine hakimiyet

Eksik tarafı: ödeme, hızlı web versiyonu, real-time katman

Eğer “para odaklı MVP” çıkarmak istersen:

Backend’i Convex/Clerk gibi SaaS tabanlı bir sistemle değiştirmene gerek yok
(Zaten Hono + Vercel edge mimarisi aynı hızda çalışıyor).

Ama web tabanlı Next.js “YBIS Web” sürümü eklemek büyük fark yaratır — React Native ile paralel ilerleyebilir.

Clerk Billing veya doğrudan Stripe Checkout ekleyerek ilk gelir hattını açabilirsin.

Tüm bunlar BUSINESS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP’ta belirtilen “Phase 1: ₺10 000 MRR” hedefiyle uyumlu olur.

🧠 Sonuç
Video’daki tech-stack felsefesi (hızlı MVP, minimum bakım, hızlı gelir) ile YBIS’in vizyonu birebir aynı; sadece araç seti farklı.
Senin mimarin:

Daha esnek (self-hosted, veritabanı kontrolü sende)

Daha teknik (gerçek AI entegrasyonları)

Uzun vadede daha sürdürülebilir

Ama kısa vadede Next.js + Clerk + Stripe tabanlı bir web arayüz eklersen, videodaki “blazingly fast money-making stack” ile aynı hızda ticari validasyon alabilirsin.

Bi de şey olacak ya zaten port port mimari muhabbeti backend as a service bayaaa mantıklı değil mi aslında hem de expo go kullanıyoruö falan
ChatGPT:

18s boyunca düşündüm
Kesinlikle mantıklı—hele Port/Adapter (Hexagonal) mimariyle düşününce BaaS (Convex/Supabase/Firebase) tam “tak-çıkar” bir parça gibi çalışıyor. Üstüne bir de Expo Go kullanıyorsan, native modül derdi yaşamadan hızlı MVP çıkarma tarafında BaaS bayağı avantajlı.

Neden Port/Adapter + BaaS iyi gider?
Domain’i kilitlemezsin: İş kuralların (domain) BaaS’tan habersiz kalır. Yarın Convex → Supabase’e geçmek sadece adapter değişimidir.

Hızlı MVP: Auth, realtime, dosya, veritabanı 1–2 günde ayağa kalkar.

Expo Go uyumu: JS/HTTP SDK’lı servisler (Convex, Supabase, Clerk) derlemesiz çalışır.

Kısa karar rehberi (Expo Go odaklı)
Realtime + tip güvenliği + minimal backend kodu: Convex

SQL (Postgres), geniş ekosistem, edge functions: Supabase

“Her şey tek yerden + basit” isteyenler için: Convex + Clerk iyi ikili

Ödeme akışı (Expo Go): Native Stripe SDK yerine Stripe Checkout (in-app browser/webview) — Clerk Billing de zaten web tabanlı.

Port/Adapter iskeleti (özet)
Domain arayüzleri:

// domain/ports/TasksRepo.ts
export interface Task {
  id: string; title: string; done: boolean; createdAt: string;
}
export interface TasksRepo {
  list(): Promise<Task[]>;
  create(input: { title: string }): Promise<Task>;
  toggle(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
Convex adapter:

// adapters/convex/TasksRepoConvex.ts
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";
import { convex } from "./client";
import type { TasksRepo, Task } from "@/domain/ports/TasksRepo";

export class TasksRepoConvex implements TasksRepo {
  async list(): Promise<Task[]> {
    return await convex.query(api.tasks.list, {});
  }
  async create({ title }: { title: string }) {
    return await convex.mutation(api.tasks.create, { title });
  }
  async toggle(id: string) {
    await convex.mutation(api.tasks.toggle, { id });
  }
}
Supabase adapter:

// adapters/supabase/TasksRepoSupabase.ts
import { supabase } from "./client";
import type { TasksRepo, Task } from "@/domain/ports/TasksRepo";

export class TasksRepoSupabase implements TasksRepo {
  async list(): Promise<Task[]> {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from("tasks").select("*").order("createdAt");
    if (error) throw error;
    return data as Task[];
  }
  async create({ title }: { title: string }) {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from("tasks").insert({ title }).select().single();
    if (error) throw error;
    return data as Task;
  }
  async toggle(id: string) {
    const { error } = await supabase.rpc("toggle_task", { task_id: id }); // örnek
    if (error) throw error;
  }
}
Composition (tek satır değişimle BaaS swap):

// app/di.ts
import { TasksRepoConvex } from "@/adapters/convex/TasksRepoConvex";
// import { TasksRepoSupabase } from "@/adapters/supabase/TasksRepoSupabase";

export const tasksRepo = new TasksRepoConvex();
// ileride supabase'e geç: new TasksRepoSupabase()
Expo Go ile dikkat etmen gerekenler
Native modül gerektiren SDK’lardan kaçın (Expo Go’da çalışmaz). Convex, Supabase, Clerk’in web/JS SDK’ları uygundur.

Auth: Clerk’in clerk-expo paketi (AuthSession) veya Supabase Auth (deep link) çalışır. Google OAuth token’larını domain katmanına taşımayın, adapter yönetsin.

Payments: Stripe’ın web Checkout/Customer Portal’ını WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync ile aç; webhook ve durum senkronu için ya Clerk Billingi kullan ya da backend’de minimal Stripe webhook handler yaz.

Realtime: Convex’te “otomatik”, Supabase’de realtime kanalları. UI tarafında store (Zustand) ile tek kaynaktan besle.

Offline stratejisi: BaaS ne olursa olsun küçük bir offline queue (AsyncStorage) ekle; ağ gelince adapter flush etsin.

Vendor lock-in’i azaltma checklist’i
 Tüm veri erişimi port arayüzlerinden geçiyor

 Adapter içinde mapping yap (BaaS record → domain entity)

 Migration planı: “export → transform → import” scriptleri

 Domain seviyesinde UUID sen üret (BaaS ID’lerine yapışma)

 Ücret/limit izleme: günlük metrikleri logla (RLS, rate, quotas)

YBIS’e özel hızlı yol
Web kolu (Next.js + shadcn) + Clerk: 1–2 haftada satışa hazır bir dashboard

Mobile (Expo Go) tarafında Convex veya Supabase adapter’ı ile Tasks/Notes/Calendar’ı ayağa kaldır

Ödeme: İlk fazda Stripe Checkout (web); ikinci fazda Clerk Billing

A/B: Convex (hız/real-time) vs Supabase (SQL/ekosistem) — adapter swap ile test et

Özet: Evet, Port/Adapter + BaaS kombinasyonu Expo Go senaryosunda çok mantıklı. Domain’i ports üzerinden izole ettiğin sürece bugün Convex ile “uçup kaçarsın”, yarın gerekirse Supabase’e “klik” diye geçersin. En hızlı gelir üreten yol da bu.

Makul peki serverless yapalım desek hiç olmaz dimi
ChatGPT:

11s boyunca düşündüm
Olmaz olur mu—tam tersi, YBIS’i tamamen serverless kurgulamak gayet mümkün ve senin “Port/Adapter + BaaS + Expo Go” yaklaşımınla çok iyi oturuyor. Sadece doğru parçaları seçip sınırlarını bilmek gerekiyor.

Kısa cevap
Evet, serverless olur.

En hızlı rota: UI (Next.js + Expo Go) → Auth/Billing (Clerk) → DB & Realtime (Convex veya Supabase) → Edge/Functions (Hono/Vercel) → Cache/Queue (Upstash).

Önerilen serverless blueprint (YBIS)
Web UI: Next.js (Vercel Edge).

Mobile: Expo Go (native modülsüz SDK’lar → problemsiz).

Auth + Billing: Clerk (JWT + hosted UI, Stripe entegrasyonu).

Veri & Realtime (2 seçenek):

Convex: Tip-güvenli, realtime “out-of-the-box”. Minimum backend kodu.

Supabase (Neon Postgres): SQL isterim diyorsan; Realtime kanallar + Edge Functions.

API/Orkestrasyon: Hono + Vercel Functions/Edge (sana zaten tanıdık).

Cache/Rate limit/Queue: Upstash Redis + Queues (serverless-compatible).

Dosya/Storage: Cloudflare R2 veya S3-compatible.

Background jobs / cron: Inngest veya Vercel/Cloudflare Queues + Cron.

Realtime (alternatif): Ably/Pusher (Convex/Supabase kullanmıyorsan).

Ödemeler: Stripe Checkout ya da Clerk Billing (webhook/“durum senkronu” dertlerini Clerk üstlenir).

Artılar / Eksiler (dürüst tablo)
Artılar

Devops yok denecek kadar az, MVP hızı maksimum.

Edge’de düşük gecikme, ölçekleme otomatik.

Expo Go ile native derleme derdi olmadan prototip → test → iterasyon.

Eksiler / Dikkat

Zaman sınırı: Functions 10–60s civarı. Uzun işlemleri Queue + worker’a at.

Cold start: Edge ile azalır; yine de kritik path’te aşırı ağır bağımlılıklardan kaçın.

WebSocket/uzun bağlantılar: Convex/Supabase/Ably gibi hazır servisle çöz; kendi soket sunucunu function’da tutma.

Büyük batch işler / AI uzun akışlar: Parçala (chunk), durable job olarak koştur; UI’yı realtime ilerleme ile besle.

Port/Adapter ile nasıl “tak-çıkar” yaparsın?
Domain tarafında Ports tanımlı (TasksRepo, NotesRepo, AuthPort…).

ConvexAdapter ve SupabaseAdapter yaz: bugün Convex, yarın tek satırda Supabase.

ID/şema standardını domain’de tut (vendor ID’lerine kilitlenme).

“Export → Transform → Import” scriptleri hazırla (olası migration günü için).

Hangi durumda “serverfull” ek parça gerekir?
>60s süren işler: video işleme, çok büyük AI pipeline’ları. → Ayrı worker (Fly.io/Render) ya da Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects.

Özel protokol/soket yönetimi: Kendi stateful gateway’in şartsa (çoğu projede gerekmez).

Pratik başlangıç planı (2 sprint)
Auth/Billing: Clerk’i bağla, Stripe Checkout ile tahsilat aç.

Data/Realtime: Convex (en hızlı) veya Supabase’i Tasks/Notes için adapter’la entegre et.

API/Edge: Hono’yu Vercel Functions/Edge’e taşı; sadece zorunlu “server side” mantığı burada kalsın.

Queue/Cron: Upstash Queue + Inngest ile uzun süreçleri jobs’a böl.

Telemetry: Request ID, rate limit, hata izleme (Sentry) — serverless’ta görünürlük kritik.

Özet: Serverless “hiç olmaz” değil; YBIS için en hızlı ve en düşük bakım maliyetli yol. Expo Go + BaaS + Edge üçlüsüyle MVP’yi çok seri çıkarırsın; Port/Adapter disipliniyle de vendor lock-in’i minimize edersin.

Şunu dedin:
Bakalım ya ben daha app arayüzğnü falan geliştiriyorum da bu bakış açısına bir bakalım auth falan nasıl olur peki google oath ile woerkspaceye bağlanmak istense
ChatGPT:

8s boyunca düşündüm
Süper—UI’yi iterken “auth + Google Workspace bağlama” işini paralelde netleştirelim. Aşağıya serverless + Expo Go (mobil) ve Next.js (web) için iki pratik yol koydum:

Clerk üzerinden Google’ı IdP olarak bağlamak (en hızlı, billing’i de alırsın)

Kendi Google OAuth’ını kurmak (daha esnek; Workspace admin/Service Account senaryolarını da kapsar)

1) En Kolay Yol: Clerk + Google (IdP) + (Opsiyonel) Billing
Akış (mobil + web)
Kullanıcı → Clerk (Google ile gir)

Clerk JWT üretir → Convex/Supabase/Backend adapter’ına “kanıt” olarak verirsin

Workspace verisine erişmen gerekiyorsa: Backend’inde (Vercel Function) Google OAuth tokenları için “bağla” butonu koy (Clerk ile oturum + Google ile kaynak erişimi ayrı kavramlar).

Yani: Kimlik = Clerk, Kaynak erişimi = Google OAuth bağlama.

Neden iyi?
Expo Go’da native derleme yok → clerk-expo + AuthSession ile çalışır

Stripe/Clerk Billing tek panelden hallolur (webhook derdi minimal)

JWT → Convex/Supabase ile sıfır sürtünme (JWT template)

Copy-paste adımlar (özet)
Clerk’te “Sign in with Google” aç

Mobilde clerk-expo ile oturum al

Uygulamada “Google Workspace’e bağla” butonu → backend’inde /google/connect linki alıp tarayıcı aç

Callback’te code → tokenları al, Redis’te şifreli sakla (kullanıcı id = Clerk userId)

2) Esnek Yol: “Kendi” Google OAuth’ı (Workspace Ready)
Kimlik de Google ise: ilk girişte Google OAuth (PKCE) ile sign-in.
Kimlik ayrı (Clerk) ise: ekstra “Google’ı bağla” akışı yap.

İki kullanım tarzı
(A) Kullanıcı OAuth’ı (User Consent)

Kullanıcı kendi hesabını bağlar → Gmail/Calendar/Tasks verilerine sadece kendi adına erişirsin.

Scopes:

email, profile (kimlik)

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks
(İhtiyacın kadar ver; incremental auth yapabilirsin.)

(B) Workspace Admin (Domain-Wide) / Marketplace App

G Suite admin panelinden domain-wide delegation ile service account yetkilendirirsin.

Avantaj: Kullanıcıya tek tek OAuth göstermeden, “kullanıcı adına” erişebilirsin.

Dezavantaj: Kurulum/admin onayı gerekir; Marketplace app paketi hazırlamak gerekir.

Not: Bu yol genelde takım/kurum ürünleri için.

Serverless uyumlu akış (A: User OAuth)
Mobil (Expo Go, PKCE)

expo-auth-session ile Google OAuth URL’sini aç

Redirect → yourapp://callback (Expo scheme) veya AuthSession proxy

Client secret kullanma (PKCE yeterli)

code’u backend’ine gönder (Vercel Function)

Backend (Hono @ Vercel)

/auth/google/url → PKCE verifier’ı sakla (Redis), URL üret

/auth/google/callback → code + verifier ile tokenları al

refresh_token varsa AES-GCM ile şifrele → Upstash Redis’te tokens:userId key’ine yaz

Access token yoksa refresh’le yenile; Google’a bu backend’den gider (mobilde gizli kalır)

Token yaşam döngüsü

Access token 1h → yenilemek için refresh token

Her istekten önce backend ensureAccessToken(userId) yapar (gerekirse refresh)

Asla refresh token’ı mobile yollama; mobile sadece backend API çağırır.

Hızlı dosya/endpoint iskeleti
Mobil (pseudo)

// Google'ı bağla
const url = await api.get<{ url: string }>('/auth/google/url');
const result = await WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync(url, redirectUri);
// redirect sonrası bundan bir "success" state alırsın

// API çağrısı (artık backend tarafı Google'a erişebilir)
await api.get('/google/calendar/today');
Backend (Hono)

app.get('/auth/google/url', async c => {
  const { codeVerifier, url } = buildGoogleAuthUrl({ scopes, redirectUri });
  await redis.set(`pkce:${sessionId}`, codeVerifier, { ex: 300 });
  return c.json({ url });
});

app.get('/auth/google/callback', async c => {
  const code = c.req.query('code');
  const codeVerifier = await redis.get(`pkce:${sessionId}`);
  const tokens = await exchangeCodeForTokens({ code, codeVerifier, redirectUri });
  // { access_token, refresh_token, expiry }
  await saveEncryptedTokens(userId, tokens);
  return c.redirect('/connected'); // mobilde "ok" ekranı
});

// Örnek korumalı kaynak
app.get('/google/calendar/today', withUser, async c => {
  const tokens = await ensureAccessToken(c.var.userId);
  const res = await fetch('https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?...', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${tokens.access_token}` }
  });
  return c.json(await res.json());
});
Token saklama

// AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt helpers (Node crypto)
const key = await getKeyFromEnv(); // 32-byte
await redis.set(`gTokens:${userId}`, encryptJSON(tokens), { ex: 60*60*24*30 });
Expo Go notları (çok önemli)
Native SDK isteyen auth paketlerinden kaçın. expo-auth-session veya clerk-expo kullan.

iOS/Android redirect scheme’lerini app.json/app.config’de ekle.

WebView yerine AuthSession kullan; cookie sorunları azalır.

Stripe: mobile’da “Checkout (Hosted)” aç → webhook/backend ile senkron; Clerk Billing kullanırsan bu kısmı Clerk üstlenir.

Workspace (Domain-Wide) seçeneği ne zaman?
Ürünün hedefi ekip/şirket ise, her kullanıcıdan OAuth istemek yerine admin bağlar → tüm kullanıcı posta/kalenderine erişim (scope ve izinlere göre).

Gerekli parçalar:

Google Cloud’da Service Account + domain-wide delegation

Admin konsolunda OAuth scopes tanımları

Marketplace app (yayın) — kurulum ve inceleme süreçleri var

Bu senaryoda token saklama: service account JWT’yi impersonate hedef kullanıcıya çevirme (short-lived token), refresh token yok.

Güvenlik ve en iyi pratikler (kısa check-list)
 Scopes’u minimal tut (okuma/readonly ile başla).

 Incremental auth (ilk gün sadece Calendar, sonra “Gmail de lazım mı?”).

 Refresh token’ı sadece backend’de, şifreli sakla.

 Rotation & revoke: Kullanıcı disconnect edince Redis keylerini sil.

 Rate limit (kullanıcı/endpoint bazlı) + Request-ID + audit log.

 Background sync için Queues/Cron (Inngest/Upstash) kullan; function timeout’a takılma.

 PII veriyi loglama; hata loglarında kırp.

Hangisini seçelim?
Tek başına hızlı MVP + Expo Go + serverless:
→ Clerk (kimlik) + “Google’ı bağla” akışı (kendi backend’in) = en az sürtünme.

SQL ve açık şema istiyorum:
→ Clerk + Supabase; Google bağlama yine backend’inden.

Realtime/Type-safe en hızlı:
→ Clerk + Convex; Google bağlama yine backend’inden.

İstersen, mevcut repo yapına göre (Hono + Vercel + Redis var) sana hazır dosya/route iskeletleri (copy-paste) de çıkarırım: /auth/google/url, /auth/google/callback, token util’leri ve Expo AuthSession setup’ı dahil.
