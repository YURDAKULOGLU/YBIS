## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-09-24 - Extended Spec-Kit Integration
**Branch**: master
**Problem**: Needed session continuity and architectural quality standards
**Decision**: Implement extended Spec-Kit with 4 core commands
**Rationale**: Prevent context loss and maintain code quality across sessions
**Impact**: All future development sessions and architectural decisions
**Trade-offs**: Small setup overhead for significant productivity gains
**Quality Check**: Integrated with existing Spec-Kit infrastructure

### 2025-09-24 - Hybrid Monorepo Strategy (ADR-001)
**Branch**: master
**Problem**: Previous YBIS had critical dependency conflicts and build issues
**Decision**: NPM Workspaces foundation + selective NX integration
**Rationale**: Balance simplicity (npm) with power (nx) - progressive enhancement
**Impact**: All fresh start development, build system, dependency management
**Trade-offs**: Dual-tool complexity vs robust foundation with escape hatches
**Quality Check**: Prevents docs-identified critical configuration errors

## Architecture Context

### Current Development Phase
- [x] Rapid Prototype (anything goes)
- [x] Beta (functional but not polished) - Firebase stack
- [ ] **MVP (production ready core)** - **MIGRATION TARGET**
- [ ] Scale (enterprise grade)

### Active Quality Standards
**Last Generated**: 2025-09-24
**Pattern**: TypeScript Project with Constitutional Compliance
**Key Rules**: Zero Workaround Policy, Clean Code Architecture, 50-line function limit, 3-level if-else max
**Location**: `.specify/quality/standards-typescript-project-2025-09-24.md`

### Technical Debt Map
**High Risk (avoid changes)**:
- (To be identified during development)

**Medium Risk (test thoroughly)**:
- (To be identified during development)

**Safe Changes (low coupling)**:
- (To be identified during development)

## Session History Archive

### 2025-09-24 - Extended Spec-Kit Setup
**Outcome**: Successfully integrated extended commands with existing Spec-Kit
**Lessons**: Proper integration requires respecting existing infrastructure
**Quality Impact**: Foundation established for quality standards
**Next Steps**: Generate quality standards for chosen architectural pattern

### 2025-09-24 - Quality Standards Generation
**Branch**: master
**Problem**: Need enforceable code and workflow standards aligned with constitution
**Decision**: Generate comprehensive TypeScript and GitHub branching standards
**Rationale**: Prevent technical debt through automated quality gates and consistent workflows
**Impact**: All future development must follow constitutional compliance standards
**Trade-offs**: Initial setup overhead for long-term code quality assurance
**Quality Standards Created**: TypeScript project standards + GitHub branching workflow standards
