## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

**"Build for Scale, Ship Minimal"**

- **Ship:** Individual users, minimal features (Google Workspace)
- **Build:** Infrastructure for vertical plugins, team features, enterprise deployment
- **Decide:** Post-release based on market feedback

**Technical Principles:**
- ✅ Port Architecture (easy tech migration pre-release)
- ✅ Plugin System (vertical feature expansion ready)
- ✅ LLM Auto-Routing (cost optimization infrastructure)
- ✅ Multi-Provider Support (workspace flexibility)
