## 🔄 **Migration & Tech Evolution**

### **Port Architecture Evolution**
```yaml
Pre-Release (Closed + Open Beta):
  purpose: "Easy tech migration during development"
  examples:
    - Expo Auth → Supabase Auth (if needed)
    - Vercel → Cloudflare (cost optimize)
    - OpenAI → Anthropic (performance test)

Post-Release:
  purpose: "Multi-provider user features"
  examples:
    - User connects Google Calendar + Outlook
    - User mixes Gmail + Outlook email
```

### **LLM Strategy Evolution**
```yaml
Closed Beta: "OpenAI only"
Open Beta: "Auto-routing testing (GPT-3.5/4)"
MVP: "Production routing (kesinleşmiş)"
Future: "Multi-model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)"
```

### **Deployment Evolution**
```yaml
Closed Beta: "Vercel Edge (serverless)"
Open Beta: "Vercel or Cloudflare (cost analysis)"
MVP: "Kesinleşmiş provider (DeploymentPort)"
Enterprise (if): "Local server (NodeServerAdapter)"
```

## 🎯 **Strategic Decision Points**

### **Fork Decision Matrix**

**Vertical Plugin Launch:**
```yaml
IF:
  - User demand >30% for specific vertical AND
  - Revenue potential >$50K ARR from vertical AND
  - Plugin infrastructure proven in production

THEN: Ship vertical plugin

ELSE: Infrastructure unutilized (OK, we hedged bets)
```

**Team/KOBİ Path:**
```yaml
IF:
  - Enterprise customer requests >10 AND
  - ARR potential >$500K AND
  - Team infrastructure feasible (development cost justified)

THEN: Develop team/KOBİ features

ELSE: Focus on individual enhancement
```

**MCP Integration:**
```yaml
IF:
  - >15 integrations planned OR
  - Third-party developer interest validated OR
  - Integration maintenance cost >30% dev time

THEN: Migrate to MCP

ELSE: Continue port architecture
```

## 📋 **Critical TBDs (To Be Determined)**

### **Open Beta TBDs**
- [ ] LLM routing strategy finalized (cost vs quality balance)
- [ ] Web dashboard scope (read-only vs full parity)
- [ ] Plugin system performance (sandboxing, security)

### **MVP TBDs**
- [ ] Pricing tiers finalized (cost analysis complete)
- [ ] Plugin launch decision (Finance? Student? None?)
- [ ] Deployment provider (Vercel vs Cloudflare)

### **Post-Release TBDs**
- [ ] Vertical path activation (market demand validation)
- [ ] Team/KOBİ path activation (enterprise interest)
- [ ] MCP migration decision (ecosystem maturity)
