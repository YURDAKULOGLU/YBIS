## User Experience (UX) Requirements

### UX-001: Onboarding Flow

**Goal:** Get user to first value (AI interaction) within 5 minutes.

**Flow:**
```
1. Welcome Screen
   ├─> "YBIS orchestrates all your productivity tools"
   └─> CTA: "Sign in with Google"

2. Google Sign-In
   ├─> OAuth flow (Firebase Auth)
   └─> Permission: Email, basic profile

3. Personalization (Optional)
   ├─> "Which tools do you use?" (Notion, Todoist, Google, Other)
   └─> Skip option (defer to later)

4. First Workflow
   ├─> "Try asking: 'What's on my schedule today?'"
   ├─> AI responds with example data (if no calendar yet)
   └─> Success: User sees AI chat working

5. Integration Setup (Deferred)
   ├─> "Connect Google Calendar for real data"
   └─> CTA: "Connect Later" (don't force)
```

**Success Metric:** >70% users complete first AI interaction within 5 minutes.

---

### UX-002: Chat Interface Design

**Principles:**
- **Conversational:** AI responses feel natural, not robotic
- **Forgiving:** Typos and ambiguous queries handled gracefully
- **Contextual:** AI remembers previous conversation (5+ messages)
- **Proactive:** AI suggests next actions (e.g., "Would you like me to schedule that?")

**UI Elements:**
- Chat bubbles (user vs. AI)
- Quick reply buttons (suggested actions)
- Loading indicator (AI thinking...)
- Voice input button (microphone icon)
- Conversation history (scrollable)

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "what's today"
AI: "Here's your schedule for today:
     - 9am: Team standup
     - 2pm: Client meeting
     - 5pm: Gym

     You also have 3 tasks due today. Want to see them?"

     [Show Tasks] [Add Event]
```

---

### UX-003: Mobile-First Design

**Screen Sizes:**
- Small: iPhone SE (4.7", 375x667)
- Medium: iPhone 13 (6.1", 390x844)
- Large: iPhone 13 Pro Max (6.7", 428x926)
- Tablet: iPad (10.2", 810x1080) - Phase 2+

**Navigation:**
- Bottom tab bar (5 tabs max):
  - Chat (primary)
  - Tasks
  - Calendar
  - Notes
  - Settings

**Gestures:**
- Swipe to complete task
- Pull to refresh
- Long-press for context menu

**Dark Mode:**
- Support system dark mode (iOS/Android)
- Auto-switch based on time (optional)

### Data Model (Core Entities)

```typescript
// User
interface User {
  id: string;              // UUID
  email: string;           // Google email
  displayName: string;     // User's name
  createdAt: Date;
  subscription: 'free' | 'lite' | 'full' | 'pro';
  aiQuota: number;         // Remaining AI messages (monthly)
}

// Task
interface Task {
  id: string;
  userId: string;          // Owner
  title: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  completed: boolean;
  source: 'ybis' | 'todoist' | 'gmail';  // Integration source
  externalId?: string;     // Third-party ID (Todoist, etc.)
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Note
interface Note {
  id: string;

  createdAt: Date;
}
```

---

### API Design (RESTful)

**Base URL:** `https://api.ybis.app/v1`

**Authentication:** Bearer token (JWT from Firebase Auth)

**Endpoints:**

```
# AI Chat
POST   /chat/messages                 # Send message to AI
GET    /chat/history                  # Retrieve conversation history

GET    /user/data-export              # Export all data (GDPR)
```

---

### Integration Architecture

**Adapter Pattern:** Standardized interface for all integrations

```typescript
interface IntegrationAdapter {
  authenticate(userId: string): Promise<AuthResult>;
  sync(userId: string): Promise<SyncResult>;
  createTask(userId: string, task: Task): Promise<Task>;
  updateTask(userId: string, taskId: string, updates: Partial<Task>): Promise<Task>;
  // ... similar methods for notes, calendar
}

class GoogleAdapter implements IntegrationAdapter {
  // Google-specific implementation
}

class NotionAdapter implements IntegrationAdapter {
  // Notion-specific implementation
}

class TodoistAdapter implements IntegrationAdapter {
  // Todoist-specific implementation
}
```

**Benefits:**
- New integrations easy to add (implement interface)
- Core logic integration-agnostic
- Testing simplified (mock adapters)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Levels

**Unit Tests (70% coverage target):**
- Business logic (task management, workflow engine)
- API endpoints (Hono routes)
- Utility functions (date formatting, string parsing)
- Integration adapters (mocked external APIs)

**Integration Tests (20% coverage):**
- API + Database integration
- OAuth flows (Google Sign-In)
- Third-party API integration (Google Calendar, Gmail)
- Real-time sync scenarios

**End-to-End Tests (10% coverage):**
- Critical user journeys (signup → first AI interaction)
- Workflow execution (morning routine)
- Cross-device sync

**Manual Testing:**
- UX flows (onboarding, feature discovery)
- Accessibility (screen reader, voice input)
- Device compatibility (iOS + Android, various screen sizes)

---

### Quality Gates

**Pre-Release Checklist:**

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions

**Q1: Database Strategy**
- **Options:** Supabase PostgreSQL vs. Serverless (Vercel Postgres) vs. Firebase Firestore
- **Decision Criteria:** Real-time sync needs, cost, offline-first architecture
- **Timeline:** Decide by end of Week 2 (architecture design phase)
- **Recommendation:** Supabase (real-time subscriptions, familiar PostgreSQL, cost-effective)

**Q2: Sync Strategy**
- **Options:** Real-time (WebSockets) vs. Batch (polling every 30s)
- **Decision Criteria:** User experience needs, battery impact, infrastructure cost
- **Timeline:** Validate during Phase 0 prototyping
- **Recommendation:** Hybrid (real-time for chat, batch for background sync)

**Q3: AI Provider**
- **Options:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini vs. Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku vs. Multi-provider
- **Decision Criteria:** Cost ($), quality, API reliability, rate limits
- **Timeline:** Test during Phase 0, finalize before Open Beta
- **Recommendation:** Start with OpenAI (simpler), add Anthropic as fallback (Phase 1)

---

### Product Decisions

**Q4: Integration Priority**
- **Options:** Google → Notion → Todoist OR Google → Todoist → Notion
- **Decision Criteria:** User demand (beta feedback), integration complexity
- **Timeline:** Validate during Closed Beta user interviews
- **Recommendation:** Google (Phase 1) → Todoist (Phase 2, simpler API) → Notion (Phase 2, complex)

**Q5: Pricing Tiers**
- **Options:**
  - Simple: Free + Pro ($10/month)
  - Standard: Free + Lite ($5) + Pro ($15)
  - Complex: Free + Lite ($5) + Full ($12) + Pro ($20)
- **Decision Criteria:** Unit economics (cost per user), competitive analysis, feature gating strategy
- **Timeline:** Determine during Open Beta cost analysis
- **Recommendation:** Start with Standard (3 tiers), simplify to 2 if conversion data suggests

**Q6: Web Dashboard Priority**
- **Options:** Mobile-only (Phase 0-2) OR Mobile + Web (launch together)
- **Decision Criteria:** User demand, development effort, competitive positioning
- **Timeline:** Assess during Closed Beta (if >30% users request web, prioritize for MVP)
- **Recommendation:** Mobile-only MVP, add web dashboard in Phase 2 (post-monetization)
