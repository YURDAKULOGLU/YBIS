# Session Report — Codex CLI (2025-10-27)

## 1. Executive Summary
- Reproduced the user’s TypeScript error output complaining about missing React Native declarations and unsupported `--module` arguments.
- Identified the root cause as running a mismatched/global `tsc` binary instead of the workspace-pinned TypeScript 5.9.3.
- Verified that project scripts (`pnpm --filter @ybis/mobile type-check`) succeed with the repository’s configuration and confirmed that `skipLibCheck` must remain enabled because of upstream React Native globals.
- Documented the resolution path in `tsconfig.base.json:48` to prevent future regressions.

## 2. Timeline of Key Actions
| Time (approx.) | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| 00:00          | Investigated reported compiler errors: missing `react-native` type declarations and invalid `--module` setting. |
| 00:05          | Ran `pnpm --filter @ybis/mobile type-check`; observed success when using the monorepo’s TypeScript toolchain. |
| 00:10          | Confirmed global TypeScript (older version) is the only context where the error appears. |
| 00:15          | Re-ran monorepo-wide type-check (`pnpm type-check`) to ensure the mobile package passes; noted unrelated lint failure in `packages/i18n` (pre-existing). |
| 00:18          | Added documentation comment to `tsconfig.base.json` explaining why `skipLibCheck` remains `true` under the current React Native setup. |
| 00:20          | Prepared this comprehensive session report per user request. |

## 3. Technical Findings
- **TypeScript Version Mismatch**  
  - The monorepo pins **TypeScript 5.9.3** (see `pnpm list typescript`).  
  - Running `tsc` globally (older version) produces errors:  
    - `Argument for '--module' option must be …`  
    - `Cannot find type definition file for 'react-native'`  
  - Using the correct binary (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/mobile/tsconfig.json`) resolves both errors.

- **React Native Type Definitions**  
  - `react-native@0.81.5` ships its own `types/` folder.  
  - When the workspace TypeScript is used, those definitions load automatically; no extra `@types/react-native` package is required.

- **skipLibCheck Justification**  
  - Attempting to disable `skipLibCheck` surfaces hundreds of conflicts between the RN `globals.d.ts` and DOM libraries (duplicate `Blob`, `FormData`, `URL`, `WebSocket`, etc.).  
  - For stability, `skipLibCheck` must remain `true`; this rationale is now captured directly in `tsconfig.base.json:48`.

- **Existing Test Noise**  
  - Repository-wide `pnpm type-check` still fails because of `packages/i18n/src/index.ts` (unused `I18nextProvider`). This predates the session and was not modified.

## 4. Recommended Developer Workflow
1. **TypeScript commands** – Always invoke via PNPM:  
   ```
   pnpm --filter @ybis/mobile type-check
   pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/mobile/tsconfig.json
   ```
   (Avoid bare `tsc` to prevent version drift.)
2. **Global TS usage** – If absolutely necessary, install the matching version globally:  
   `npm i -g typescript@5.9.3` or `pnpm dlx typescript@5.9.3 tsc …`.
3. **skipLibCheck** – Leave enabled until upstream React Native definitions are patched or custom shims are introduced.

## 5. Outstanding Items / Future Work
- Decide whether to patch React Native’s globals (or maintain a shim) so the project can eventually run with `skipLibCheck: false`.
- Clean up the `packages/i18n` unused export warning that causes the root `pnpm type-check` command to fail.
- Consider documenting this workflow in the developer onboarding guide for quicker diagnosis next time.
