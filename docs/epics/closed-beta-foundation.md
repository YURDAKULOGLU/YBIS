# Epic: Closed Beta Foundation

**Epic ID:** E-CB-001  
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress  
**Owner:** YBIS Team  
**Timeline:** 2025-10-29 → 2025-11-05 (7 days)  
**Target:** Closed Beta MVP Launch (100-200 users)

---

## 🎯 Vision

Build the minimal but complete foundation for YBIS Closed Beta:
- Supabase-based backend (Auth + DB + Storage + Vector)
- Google OAuth authentication
- Core CRUD operations (Notes, Tasks, Flows)
- Google Calendar integration
- RAG system (document upload + query)
- AI Tool Calling (natural language commands)
- Error monitoring + Push notifications

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

**Build for Scale, Ship Minimal:**
- ✅ Port Architecture (AuthPort, DatabasePort, LLMPort, RAGPort, CalendarPort)
- ✅ Single provider per port (Supabase, OpenAI, Google)
- ✅ Swap-ready for MVP (easy migration)
- ✅ Workspace-based data model (multi-tenant ready)

## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Risks:**
1. **Google OAuth Rate Limits** → Mitigation: Batch token refresh
2. **Supabase Free Tier Limits** → Mitigation: Monitor usage, upgrade plan
3. **AI Tool Hallucinations** → Mitigation: Strict tool schemas, validation
