## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 9.1 Competitive Risks

**Risk 1: Well-Funded Competitor with Similar Positioning**
- **Probability:** HIGH (low barriers to entry)
- **Impact:** HIGH (direct category competition)
- **Mitigation:** Speed to market, Port Architecture agility, community moats, plugin vertical escape

**Risk 2: Big Tech Platform Integration (Google/Microsoft)**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (not strategic priority yet)
- **Impact:** VERY HIGH (distribution advantage)
- **Mitigation:** Partnership positioning, privacy differentiation (local LLM), niche focus (ADHD, freelancers)

**Risk 3: Established Players Adding Orchestration**
- **Probability:** HIGH (Notion/Todoist will respond)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (still limited to their ecosystem)
- **Mitigation:** Multi-tool advantage, Port Architecture (platform-agnostic), complement positioning

---

### 9.2 Strategic Risks

**Risk 4: Category Fails to Resonate (Users Don't Want Orchestration)**
- **Probability:** LOW (validated through user research)
- **Impact:** VERY HIGH (business model fails)
- **Mitigation:** Beta validation, early adopter feedback, plugin vertical pivot if needed

**Risk 5: Integration Partners Block/Limit Access**
- **Probability:** LOW (APIs are public, business incentive to integrate)
- **Impact:** HIGH (core value proposition threatened)
- **Mitigation:** Diversify integrations, direct partnerships, comply with ToS, Port Architecture (easy provider swap)

**Risk 6: Plugin Strategy Fails to Activate**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (market demand uncertain)
- **Impact:** LOW (core product still viable)
- **Mitigation:** Infrastructure unutilized (OK, we hedged bets), focus on Path A (Individual enhancement)
