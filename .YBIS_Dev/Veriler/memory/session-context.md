## üìã RECENT DECISIONS (Last 7)

### AD-037: TryMartin Competitor Analysis & Strategic Response
- **Date:** 2025-10-21
- **Decision:** Comprehensive competitor analysis completed for TryMartin, strategic recommendations developed.
- **Rationale:** TryMartin represents direct competition in AI productivity space, requiring strategic response and differentiation.
- **Implementation:** Created detailed competitor analysis document and strategic recommendations.
- **Impact:** Establishes competitive positioning strategy, identifies YBIS advantages, provides action plan.
- **Details:** See `docs/strategy/TRYMARTIN_COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md` and `docs/strategy/YBIS_STRATEGIC_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`

### AD-036: LoggerPort Implementation
- **Date:** 2025-10-21
- **Decision:** A `LoggerPort` was implemented to standardize logging across the application. A simple `ConsoleLogger` adapter was created as the initial implementation.
- **Rationale:** To create a centralized and swappable logging mechanism, adhering to the project's Port Architecture principles. This allows for future extension with remote logging services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) without changing application code.
- **Implementation:** A new package `@ybis/logging` was created. It exports a singleton `Logger` instance.
- **Impact:** Provides a consistent logging API for all other packages and applications.
- **Details:** See `packages/logging/` and `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-036` (to be created).

### AD-035: Drawer Navigation Implementation (Side Navigation)
- **Date:** 2025-01-20
- **Decision:** Button-only drawer with fast animation (180ms) + smooth easing. Gesture support deferred.
- **Rationale:** "Start Simple, Add Later" - Gesture attempts ‚Üí App lock, fixing loop. Ship working feature first.
- **Implementation:** Modular components (DrawerHeader/NavItem/Footer), Easing.out(Easing.cubic), glassmorphism backdrop
- **Impact:** ‚úÖ Professional side navigation working, production-ready, no spawn bug, smooth UX
- **Lessons:** Gesture complexity, animation easing (linear ‚Üí robotic; cubic ‚Üí smooth), start simple philosophy
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-035`

### AD-034: RAG Priority over Plugin System (Week 5-6)
- **Date:** 2025-10-19
- **Decision:** Prioritize RAG implementation, defer Plugin System to Week 7-8 (OTA update).
- **Rationale:** RAG = core value proposition (AI intelligence), Plugin System = nice-to-have
- **Impact:** Closed Beta ships with smart AI, Feature System added Week 7-8 via OTA
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-034`

### AD-033: Expo CLI Working Directory Requirement in Monorepos
- **Date:** 2025-10-16
- **Decision:** ALWAYS run Expo CLI from `apps/mobile/` directory, not monorepo root.
- **Root Cause:** Running `npx expo start` from root reads wrong package.json
- **Solution:** No config changes needed - just cd to correct directory
- **Impact:** Reinforces "Fix the Abstraction" - don't patch when usage is wrong
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-033`

### AD-032: Demo Mode Navigation Bug Resolution
- **Date:** 2025-10-16
- **Decision:** Fixed demo mode navigation bug with instant authentication.
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-032`

### AD-031: Mobile App Edge-to-Edge Safe Area & Keyboard-Aware Animations
- **Date:** 2025-10-16
- **Decision:** Implement comprehensive edge-to-edge safe area with keyboard-synced animations.
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Code complete, ‚ö†Ô∏è User reports sync still not perfect (needs device testing).
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-031`

### AD-030: Android Build Failure Resolution & Expo Go Migration Strategy
- **Date:** 2025-10-15
- **Decision:** Migrate to Expo Go to eliminate native build requirements.
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-030`

## üìä PROJECT STATE

### Critical Project Info
- **Package Manager:** PNPM (`pnpm`)
- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces (`workspace:*` protocol)
- **Framework:** Expo SDK 54 managed workflow
- **Type-Check Status:** ‚úÖ ALL PASSING
- **Test Status:** ‚úÖ Auth: 6/6 tests passing
- **Lint Status:** ‚úÖ 0 errors
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ ALL PACKAGES BUILDING SUCCESSFULLY
- **Mobile App:** ‚úÖ Ready for development (Expo Go)

### Dependency Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated Sub-dependencies:** `pnpm install` reports warnings for `glob@7.2.3`, `inflight@1.0.6`, and `rimraf@3.0.2`.
  - **Analysis:** These are transitive dependencies from core packages (`expo`, `react-native`).
  - **Risk:** Low. These warnings are common and can generally be ignored until the parent packages are updated.
  - **Action:** No immediate action required. Monitor for issues.

### Blockers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Decision Required (P2):** `apps/mobile/tsconfig.json` paths point to `src` instead of `dist` - violates AD-006.
  - **Impact:** Breaks build isolation, tight coupling, slow builds.
  - **Status:** Documented in DEVELOPMENT_LOG, awaiting architectural decision.
