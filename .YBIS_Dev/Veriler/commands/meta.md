## Purpose

Performs meta-level analysis of ongoing conversation to identify process patterns, behavioral patterns, and governance patterns. Suggests Constitutional amendments based on detected patterns.

## What it does

1. **Pattern Detection**: Analyzes conversation for meta patterns (how we work, not what we work on)
2. **Process Analysis**: Identifies workflow, decision-making, and interaction patterns
3. **Constitutional Review**: Suggests amendments to YBIS-Dev Constitution
4. **Amendment Workflow**: Presents numbered options for user approval
5. **Version Management**: Updates Constitution with proper version tracking

- **Governance Patterns**: How rules and standards evolve
- **Evolution Patterns**: How the system adapts and improves

## Example Output
