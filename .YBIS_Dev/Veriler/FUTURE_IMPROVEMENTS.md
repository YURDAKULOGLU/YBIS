# YBIS System: Future Improvements & Identified Blind Spots

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active
**Owner:** @ybis-master
**Description:** This document tracks strategic ideas, identified blind spots, and potential future enhancements for the YBIS AI agent system. It serves as a high-level roadmap for long-term development.

---

## 1. Technical & Architectural Enhancements

### 1.1. Environment & Secrets Management
- **Blind Spot:** The system currently lacks a standardized way to manage environment variables (API keys, database URLs) for different stages (local, dev, prod).
- **Proposed Action:** Define a clear strategy using `.env` files (`.env.example`, `.env.local`, etc.) and integrate a secrets management solution (like Doppler, or cloud-provider services) for production keys.

### 1.2. Database Schema Migrations
- **Blind Spot:** There is no defined process for handling database schema changes. This is critical for evolving the application without data loss.
- **Proposed Action:** Implement a migration tool (e.g., `node-pg-migrate` or Supabase's built-in migration tools). Define a workflow step where agents can generate or request migration scripts when a feature requires a schema change.

### 1.3. Observability & Error Monitoring
- **Blind Spot:** While Sentry is mentioned in the constitution, there is no concrete `MonitoringPort` or a defined strategy for how agents should log errors, track performance, or report system health.
- **Proposed Action:**
    1.  Define a `MonitoringPort` with methods like `logError()`, `trackPerformance()`, `captureMessage()`.
    2.  Create a `SentryAdapter` for this port.
    3.  Update the core agent logic to wrap critical operations in try/catch blocks that report failures through this port.

## 2. Process & Workflow Enhancements

### 2.1. "Rollback" & "Undo" Workflows
- **Blind Spot:** All current workflows are "happy paths." There is no defined protocol for what happens when a user wants to abort a workflow, go back a step, or undo a change an agent has made.
- **Proposed Action:** Design a `rollback` workflow. The orchestrator could maintain a state history of the active workflow, allowing a user to issue a `*rollback` command, which would trigger the orchestrator to execute the reverse action (e.g., delete a created file, revert a file change).

### 2.2. Explicit "Human Handoff" State
- **Blind Spot:** Workflows that require human intervention (e.g., generating UI on an external site) don't have a formal state. The system just waits.
- **Proposed Action:** Enhance the orchestrator to include a `paused: waiting_for_human_input` status. When in this state, the orchestrator could periodically ask the user, "I am waiting for you to complete [task]. Let me know when you are ready to proceed."

### 2.3. Parallel Work & Conflict Resolution
- **Blind Spot:** The current model is sequential. It doesn't account for multiple developers or agents working on different features simultaneously, which could lead to merge conflicts or duplicated effort.
- **Proposed Action:** This is a long-term challenge. A potential solution involves:
    1.  A central "task board" or state manager that the orchestrator controls.
    2.  Agents "lock" files or features they are working on.
    3.  The orchestrator could run a pre-check before starting a new workflow to see if it conflicts with any in-progress work.

## 3. Long-Term & Strategic Enhancements

### 3.1. Cost-Aware Cognition
- **Blind Spot:** The system is not cost-aware. It will use the best model (e.g., GPT-4) for a task, even if a much cheaper model (e.g., Claude Haiku) would suffice.
- **Proposed Action:** Enhance the orchestrator with cost-based routing. The orchestrator could maintain a cost/benefit matrix for different models and tasks, and choose the most cost-effective model that meets the quality bar for a given task. It could even propose options to the user: "I can do this quickly with GPT-4 for an estimated $0.10, or more slowly with Haiku for $0.01. Which do you prefer?"

### 3.2. Self-Registering Agents
- **Blind Spot:** The system relies on manual updates or directory scanning to know which agents are available.
- **Proposed Action:** Create a "registration" process. When a new agent is defined, a post-creation script could automatically add its metadata (ID, title, capabilities) to a central `AGENT_REGISTRY.json` file. The orchestrator would read this single file at startup, making discovery instant and removing the need for directory scanning.

### 3.3. Lowering the Documentation Barrier
- **Blind Spot:** The system's intelligence is highly dependent on perfect, manual documentation discipline.
- **Proposed Action:** Design workflows that help bridge the gap between conversation and documentation. For example, an agent could listen in on a meeting (via transcript), identify key decisions, and automatically propose an update to the `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`. This reduces the reliance on human memory and discipline.

### 3.4. Unique, Mid-Term Workflow Design
- **Goal:** Move beyond simple short-term (single feature) and long-term (full project) workflows.
- **Idea:** Design more nuanced, "mid-term" workflows. Examples:
    -   **`Tech_Debt_Paydown` Workflow:** An agent proactively scans the codebase for tech debt (using a tool like SonarQube or static analysis), creates a prioritized list of issues, and generates stories for refactoring them over a two-week sprint.
    -   **`Performance_Audit` Workflow:** An agent runs performance profiling tools, analyzes the results, identifies bottlenecks, and proposes architectural changes or specific code optimizations.
    -   **`User_Feedback_Loop` Workflow:** An agent ingests user feedback from a source (e.g., a CSV from a survey), categorizes the feedback, identifies recurring themes, and proposes new features or bug fixes by creating draft PRDs or stories.
