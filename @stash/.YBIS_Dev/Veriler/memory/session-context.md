## 📋 RECENT DECISIONS (Last 7)

### AD-039: Mobile UI Modernization & Professional Polish
- **Date:** 2025-10-27
- **Decision:** Completed comprehensive mobile UI modernization addressing all critical bugs and implementing professional polish
- **Rationale:** User reported "jumpingler" and unprofessional UI elements. Multiple bug reports identified critical issues preventing app functionality.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Phase 1:** Fixed SafeAreaView conflicts - removed nested `edges={['bottom']}` that was hiding tab bar
  - **Phase 2:** Implemented dynamic chat input height tracking for accurate spacing
  - **Phase 3:** Migrated from deprecated hooks to native Keyboard API
  - **Quality:** Maintained zero-tolerance TypeScript/lint compliance throughout
- **Impact:**
  - ✅ **Tab Bar:** Fully accessible, no overflow issues
  - ✅ **Chat Spacing:** Dynamic height tracking prevents content being hidden
  - ✅ **Keyboard:** Smooth, predictable behavior with native API
  - ✅ **Code Quality:** 0 TypeScript errors, 0 lint warnings
  - ✅ **User Experience:** Professional, smooth, no jumping animations
- **Files Modified:**
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Dynamic height + keyboard migration
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/tasks.tsx` - Removed nested SafeAreaView + debug component
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/{notes,plan,chat,settings}.tsx` - Consistent scroll padding
  - `packages/i18n/src/index.ts` - Removed unused import
- **Patterns Established:**
  - SafeAreaView: Only `edges={['top']}` in tab screens, tab bar manages bottom
  - Dynamic measurement: Use `onLayout` for component heights, not hardcoded values
  - Keyboard handling: Native `Keyboard.addListener` instead of deprecated hooks
- **Documentation:** Created comprehensive summary at `docs/reports/ui-modernization-summary-2025-10-27.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for user testing

### AD-038: Mobile UI Critical Issues Analysis & Resolution Strategy
- **Date:** 2025-10-24
- **Decision:** Comprehensive analysis of critical mobile UI issues preventing app functionality completed. Identified 6 major issues requiring immediate attention.
- **Rationale:** Mobile app is currently non-functional due to tab bar overflow and navigation system conflicts. Users cannot access tab navigation, app freezes occur, and multiple UI components have spacing/display issues.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Created detailed bug report: `docs/reports/ui bug raporu 2025-10-24.md`
  - Identified 2 critical issues (tab bar overflow, navigation conflicts) and 4 medium/low priority issues
  - Developed 3-phase resolution strategy: Quick fixes (30 min), Stabilization (1 hour), Refactor (4 hours)
- **Impact:** 
  - **Critical:** Tab bar overflow prevents basic navigation - app unusable
  - **High:** DrawerMenu and Tabs navigation conflict causes layout breaks and touch issues
  - **Medium:** Chat input spacing, app freeze issues, widget display problems
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Phase 1: Fix SafeAreaView edges={['bottom']} usage across all screens (5 min fix)
  - Phase 2: Resolve navigation system conflicts and animation listener issues
  - Phase 3: Implement Expo Router standard structure for long-term stability
- **Files Analyzed:**
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/tasks.tsx:40` - SafeAreaView edges conflict
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/chat.tsx:62` - SafeAreaView edges conflict  
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/notes.tsx:22` - SafeAreaView edges conflict
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/plan.tsx:22` - SafeAreaView edges conflict
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/settings.tsx:55` - SafeAreaView edges conflict
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx:77` - DrawerMenu/Tabs navigation conflict
  - `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx:113` - Chat input spacing calculation
- **Technical Details:** See `docs/reports/ui bug raporu 2025-10-24.md` for complete analysis
- **Risk Assessment:** App currently unusable. Quick fixes can restore basic functionality within 30 minutes.
### AD-037: TryMartin Competitor Analysis & Strategic Response
- **Date:** 2025-10-21
- **Decision:** Comprehensive competitor analysis completed for TryMartin, strategic recommendations developed.
- **Rationale:** TryMartin represents direct competition in AI productivity space, requiring strategic response and differentiation.
- **Implementation:** Created detailed competitor analysis document and strategic recommendations.
- **Impact:** Establishes competitive positioning strategy, identifies YBIS advantages, provides action plan.
- **Details:** See `docs/strategy/TRYMARTIN_COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md` and `docs/strategy/YBIS_STRATEGIC_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`

### AD-036: LoggerPort Implementation
- **Date:** 2025-10-21
- **Decision:** A `LoggerPort` was implemented to standardize logging across the application. A simple `ConsoleLogger` adapter was created as the initial implementation.
- **Rationale:** To create a centralized and swappable logging mechanism, adhering to the project's Port Architecture principles. This allows for future extension with remote logging services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) without changing application code.
- **Implementation:** A new package `@ybis/logging` was created. It exports a singleton `Logger` instance.
- **Impact:** Provides a consistent logging API for all other packages and applications.
- **Details:** See `packages/logging/` and `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-036` (to be created).

### AD-035: Drawer Navigation Implementation (Side Navigation)
- **Date:** 2025-01-20
- **Decision:** Button-only drawer with fast animation (180ms) + smooth easing. Gesture support deferred.
- **Rationale:** "Start Simple, Add Later" - Gesture attempts → App lock, fixing loop. Ship working feature first.
- **Implementation:** Modular components (DrawerHeader/NavItem/Footer), Easing.out(Easing.cubic), glassmorphism backdrop
- **Impact:** ✅ Professional side navigation working, production-ready, no spawn bug, smooth UX
- **Lessons:** Gesture complexity, animation easing (linear → robotic; cubic → smooth), start simple philosophy
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-035`

### AD-034: RAG Priority over Plugin System (Week 5-6)
- **Date:** 2025-10-19
- **Decision:** Prioritize RAG implementation, defer Plugin System to Week 7-8 (OTA update).
- **Rationale:** RAG = core value proposition (AI intelligence), Plugin System = nice-to-have
- **Impact:** Closed Beta ships with smart AI, Feature System added Week 7-8 via OTA
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-034`

### AD-033: Expo CLI Working Directory Requirement in Monorepos
- **Date:** 2025-10-16
- **Decision:** ALWAYS run Expo CLI from `apps/mobile/` directory, not monorepo root.
- **Root Cause:** Running `npx expo start` from root reads wrong package.json
- **Solution:** No config changes needed - just cd to correct directory
- **Impact:** Reinforces "Fix the Abstraction" - don't patch when usage is wrong
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-033`

### AD-032: Demo Mode Navigation Bug Resolution
- **Date:** 2025-10-16
- **Decision:** Fixed demo mode navigation bug with instant authentication.
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-032`

### AD-031: Mobile App Edge-to-Edge Safe Area & Keyboard-Aware Animations
- **Date:** 2025-10-16
- **Decision:** Implement comprehensive edge-to-edge safe area with keyboard-synced animations.
- **Status:** ✅ Code complete, ⚠️ User reports sync still not perfect (needs device testing).
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-031`

### AD-030: Android Build Failure Resolution & Expo Go Migration Strategy
- **Date:** 2025-10-15
- **Decision:** Migrate to Expo Go to eliminate native build requirements.
- **Details:** See `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#AD-030`
